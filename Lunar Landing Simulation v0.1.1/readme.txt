Currently this simulation/game is in its very early stages and needs a lot of work still- at 
least in my opinion. The objective is to land your craft on the moon without stranding or 
killing the crew. In order to do this, you need to bring your horizontal velocity down to or
very close to zero while managing your vertical velocity to prevent the craft from being too
damaged to function or explode. 

The crash tolerance for vertical velocity is 14m/s or below and the tolerance for horizontal
velocity is within -2m/s and 2m/s.


Controls:

SPACE --> toggles the engine on and off
L-SHIFT --> increases the throttle
L-CTRL --> decreases the throttle

A and LEFT ARROW --> turn pitch to the left
D and RIGHT ARROW --> turn pitch to the right
